/**
 * Test which models a queueless server, at which arrive at a rate lambda
 * = 0.5, and are completed at a rate mu = 1.0. The server has no queue, so
 * arrivals that occur whilst the system is still processing are ignored - thus
 * this system only have two states - processing and not processing a job, which
 * are being identified with the strings "Working" and "Ready"
 *
 * With the given rates, it should be obvious that the overall analysis will be
 * that the system spend 1/3 of the time in the "Working" state and 2/3 of the
 * time in the "Ready" state.
